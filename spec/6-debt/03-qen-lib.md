# Tech Debt: QEN Library

**Review the src/qen/ core library modules and identify technical debt including outdated dependencies, code duplication, missing tests, overly complex functions, inconsistent patterns, poor error handling, and areas lacking documentation or type safety.**

## Components in Scope

- `src/qen/cli.py` - CLI entry point and global options
- `src/qen/config.py` - Configuration management
- `src/qen/project.py` - Project creation and structure
- `src/qen/git_utils.py` - Git operations
- `src/qen/repo_utils.py` - Repository URL parsing and cloning
- `src/qen/pyproject_utils.py` - pyproject.toml CRUD operations
- Any other core library modules
